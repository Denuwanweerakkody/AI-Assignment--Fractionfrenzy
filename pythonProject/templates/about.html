  <h1>About Fraction Frenzy</h1>
  <p>Welcome to Fraction Frenzy! Our goal is to make learning fractions fun and interactive. Dive into topics like Simplifying Fractions, Equivalent Fractions, Adding/Subtracting Fractions.</p>
  <p>Understanding Fractions
A fraction represents a part of a whole. It consists of two numbers: the numerator and the denominator.

The numerator is the number above the fraction bar. It shows how many parts you have.
The denominator is the number below the fraction bar. It shows how many equal parts the whole is divided into.
For example, in the fraction 3/4:

The numerator is 3, which means you have 3 parts.
The denominator is 4, which means the whole is divided into 4 equal parts.
Types of Fractions
Proper Fractions: These are fractions where the numerator is smaller than the denominator. Example: 3/4, 5/8.
Improper Fractions: These are fractions where the numerator is equal to or larger than the denominator. Example: 5/3, 7/6.
Mixed Numbers: These are a whole number and a fraction combined. Example: 2 1/4.
Equivalent Fractions: These are fractions that represent the same value. Example: 1/2 and 2/4 are equivalent fractions.
Why Fractions Are Important
Fractions are everywhere! They help us measure things, divide objects, and describe parts of a whole. Whether it's sharing a pizza, dividing a set of objects, or dealing with money, understanding fractions is essential in daily life and future math studies.

Learning Fractions
Adding and Subtracting Fractions: You can add or subtract fractions when they have the same denominator. If the denominators are different, you need to find a common denominator first.

Multiplying Fractions: Multiply the numerators together and then multiply the denominators together. Simplify if necessary.

Converting Fractions to Decimals: Sometimes it's easier to work with decimals than fractions. You can convert fractions to decimals by dividing the numerator by the denominator.</p>
